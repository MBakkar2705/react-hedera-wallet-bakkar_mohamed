# ADR 0006: Continuous integration with GitHub Actions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-09

## Context

The repository has a backend with unit tests and a frontend with a linter and a build. Each of these checks can fail after a change, and running them by hand before every commit depends on remembering to do it. The repository is hosted on GitHub.

The criteria used to choose how to run the checks:

- **Automatic:** the checks run on every push and every pull request, without action from the author.
- **Same platform:** no external service or extra account to set up.
- **Same conditions as the local setup:** same Node.js version and the same locked dependencies.
- **No secrets:** the checks must not need the Hedera credentials.
- **Simplicity:** one file in the repository, easy to read.

## Decision

A GitHub Actions workflow, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, runs on every push and every pull request. It has one job, `test`, on `ubuntu-latest`, which runs these steps:

1. Checkout of the repository.
2. pnpm setup, at the version given by `packageManager`, and Node.js 22 with the pnpm cache.
3. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
4. `pnpm test`: the backend unit tests.
5. `pnpm --filter frontend lint`.
6. `pnpm --filter frontend build`.

How it meets the criteria:

1. **Automatic.** The triggers are `push` and `pull_request`. A new run on the same branch cancels the previous one still in progress (`concurrency`).
2. **Same platform.** GitHub Actions is part of GitHub, and the workflow is a file of the repository.
3. **Same conditions.** Node.js 22 is the version of the Docker image (ADR 0005), and `--frozen-lockfile` installs exactly the versions of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
4. **No secrets.** The unit tests replace the Hedera SDK and the database with mocks (ADR 0003), so no `.env` file is needed. The workflow has the permission `contents: read` only.
5. **Simplicity.** One file, one job, six steps.

## Alternatives considered

- **No CI: tests and build run by hand.** Rejected on the automatic criterion. A check that is not run is not a check, and a broken commit could reach the main branch without notice.
- **Another CI service, such as GitLab CI or CircleCI.** Rejected on the same platform criterion. The repository is on GitHub, and another service means another account, another configuration and another place to look at the results.
- **A CI that also builds the Docker image or runs the tests inside it.** Rejected on the simplicity criterion for now. It would take longer, and the image build is already run by hand (ADR 0005). It can be added later.

## Consequences

- Every push shows a check on GitHub, and a pull request shows the result before the merge.
- The CI checks what its steps cover: the backend unit tests, the frontend lint and the frontend build.
- The CI does not run the backend lint, the end-to-end test or the Docker build (`docs/backend-evolutions.md`, item 11, for the first two). The frontend has no test script.
- The workflow file is a protected file for the AI assistant (ADR 0004): the author edits it.

## Verification

### Proven

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` contains the triggers `push` and `pull_request`, `permissions: contents: read`, `concurrency`, `node-version: 22`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and the three checks `pnpm test`, `pnpm --filter frontend lint` and `pnpm --filter frontend build`.
- The CI was green on the branch `refactor/backend-folder`, on `feature/frontend-nextjs`, and on commit `d97c3c7` (reported by the author).

### Not proven

- That the CI turns red when a test fails: no failure was provoked on purpose.
- The backend lint, the end-to-end test and the Docker build: they are not in the CI.
