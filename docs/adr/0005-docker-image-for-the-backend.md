# ADR 0005: A multi-stage Docker image for the backend

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-09

## Context

The backend needs Node.js, pnpm, a compilation step for TypeScript, and the native addon of `sqlite3`. Running it on another machine means installing the same versions of these tools.

The criteria used to choose how to package and run the backend:

- **Reproducibility:** the same result on any machine, without installing Node.js or pnpm.
- **Lockfile fidelity:** the dependencies installed are exactly those of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Small runtime:** the final image contains only what is needed to run: no compiler, no development dependencies.
- **Security:** no secret in the image, and no process running as root.
- **Simplicity:** one command to build and one to run.

## Decision

The backend has a multi-stage Dockerfile, `backend/Dockerfile`, built from the repository root:

```
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t hedera-wallet .
```

How it meets the criteria:

1. **Reproducibility.** The image is based on `node:22-bookworm-slim`, and pnpm is installed with Corepack at the version given by `packageManager`.
2. **Lockfile fidelity.** The dependencies are installed with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter backend`, which fails if the lockfile and the `package.json` files disagree. The build context is the repository root because the lockfile and the workspace files are there (see ADR 0012).
3. **Small runtime.** The stages are separated: `toolchain` (compiler tools for the native addon), `build` (all dependencies, compiles TypeScript to `dist/`), `prod-deps` (production dependencies only) and `runtime`. The runtime image receives only the production dependencies, `dist/` and `package.json`.
4. **Security.** The runtime runs as the `node` user, with `NODE_ENV=production`. `.dockerignore` excludes every `.env` file, the `*.db` files, `.git`, `frontend` and `docs` from the build context. The Hedera credentials are given when the container starts:

   ```
   docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file backend/.env hedera-wallet
   ```
5. **Simplicity.** One build command and one run command, both in the README.

## Alternatives considered

- **No container: Node.js and pnpm installed on the machine.** Not replaced, kept as the other way to run the backend (see Setup in the README). Rejected as the only way on the reproducibility criterion: it depends on the versions installed on each machine.
- **A single-stage Dockerfile.** Rejected on the small runtime and security criteria. The final image would contain the development dependencies, the TypeScript compiler and the build tools of the native addon (`python3`, `make`, `g++`).
- **Docker Compose.** Rejected on the simplicity criterion. The backend is the only service: the database is a local file, and the frontend is not in the image. A Compose file would add a file without adding a service.

## Consequences

- The image contains the backend only. The frontend is not containerized.
- The credentials are not in the image, but they are in the environment of the running container, where `docker inspect` shows them to anyone who can use Docker on the machine.
- The database file `hedera-wallet.db` is written inside the container, in the working directory. It disappears with the container, unless a volume is mounted, which is not done here.
- The CORS origin is written in the code (`http://localhost:3001`), so the image allows that origin only (`docs/backend-evolutions.md`, item 9).
- Ctrl+C in the terminal does not stop the container, and `docker stop` is needed (`docs/backend-evolutions.md`, item 15).

## Verification

### Proven

- `backend/Dockerfile` has the stages `base`, `toolchain`, `build`, `prod-deps` and `runtime`, uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter backend`, sets `USER node` and `NODE_ENV=production`, and exposes port 3000.
- `.dockerignore` lists `**/.env`, `**/.env.*`, `**/*.db`, `frontend` and `docs`.
- `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t hedera-wallet .` succeeded, and the container started with `--env-file backend/.env` and served Swagger (observed by the author, see ADR 0012).
- Ctrl+C did not stop the container, and `docker stop` did (observed by the author).

### Not proven

- Requests from the host to the containerized backend that call Hedera, and where the database file ends up in the container (see ADR 0012).
- The size of the image: it was not measured.
- That `docker run --init` makes Ctrl+C work: not tried.
